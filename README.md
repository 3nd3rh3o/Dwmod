# DwMod
This mod add a TARDIS in minecraft. Currently on dev, expect some changes

Works on solo, and on server.

IMPORTANT: after updating, make sure to run /debug_reload_tardis_interrior it will rebuild all tardis interrior(recover your stuff before) the installed circuits are not reset, only blocks. Between versions, some changes can be done to the interrior, so I made this command to help player updating.


## Setup

Install fabric, make sure to have immersive portal, fabric-api and geckolib in your mod folder as well as your current dwmod version. On the download page, the version number of each dependencies are specified. OTHER VALUES ARE UNTESTED!
